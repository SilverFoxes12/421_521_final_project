Rice Bioe 421/521 final project
Mr. GARDEN – Geo-friendly Automated Robotic Dirt/Earth Nourisher
	We are proposing an automated gardening system that can sense the wetness of the soil used to house a plant and administer a specific volume of water as needed. The device will use a humidity sensor that will be placed in the soil. Periodically, the system will extract data regarding the soil hydration and will deliver the necessary volume to the plant. Additionally, the system will alert the user when the water housing unit is running low. This will be done using a different sensor (possibly a pressure, light, or different humidity sensor). This will be determined by price and efficacy.
